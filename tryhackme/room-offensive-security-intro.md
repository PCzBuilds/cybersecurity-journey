# TryHackMe: Offensive Security Intro

**Date completed:** 2025-08-29  
**Category:** Fundamentals (Offensive)

## ðŸ”‘ What I learned
- "To outsmart a hacker, you need to think like one."
- Offensive security = proactively testing systems to find weaknesses before attackers do.
- Practical example (hacking)
- Ethics and scope matter: only test what youâ€™re authorized to test.

## ðŸ§  Reflection
Understanding the attacker mindset helps me think about how to defend better. The lifecycle structure gives me a mental map for future labs.
