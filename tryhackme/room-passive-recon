# TryHackMe: Passive Reconnaissance
**Date Completed: 2025-09-27**
**Category:** Intermediate (Defensive/Forensics)**

## ðŸ”‘ What I learned

- Reconnaissance (recon) can be defined as a preliminary survey to gather information about a target.
- Passive Reconnaissance = Relying on publicly available knowledge. It is the knowledge that you can access from publicly available resources without directly engaging with the target.
Learned Tools:
- `whois` to query WHOIS servers
- `nslookup` to query DNS servers
- `dig` to query DNS servers
- DNSDumpster
- Shodan.io

## ðŸ§  Reflection

Passive Reconaissance is the safest method to gather information about a target without risking legal problems or raising attention. Activities including:

- Looking up DNS records of a domain from a public DNS server.
- Checking job ads related to the target website.
- Reading news articles about the target company.
