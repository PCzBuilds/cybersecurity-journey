# TryHackMe: OSI Model

## 🔑 What I learned
- 7 layers (P-D-N-T-S-P-A) and what typically “lives” at each layer.
- Helps isolate issues (e.g., is it DNS at Layer 7 or routing at Layer 3?).
- Protocol examples by layer (ARP/L2, IP/L3, TCP/UDP L4, HTTP/HTTPS L7).

## 🧠 Reflection
It’s more than theory—it's a troubleshooting framework I can apply during scans and investigations.
