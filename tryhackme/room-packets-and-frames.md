# TryHackMe: Packets and Frames

**Date completed:** 2025-09-09 
**Category:** Networking

## ðŸ”‘ What I learned
- Frame (Layer 2) vs Packet (Layer 3) and what each header contains.
- TCP vs UDP, ports, and the TCP three-way handshake basics.
- MTU and fragmentation and why capture tools (e.g., Wireshark) show multiple layers.

## ðŸ§  Reflection
Seeing the structure of traffic makes tools like Wireshark less intimidating and helps me reason about alerts and PCAPs.
