# Google Cybersecurity Certificate â€“ Course 1: Foundations of Cybersecurity

**Status:** Completed  
**Date:** 2025-07-09  
**Focus:** Core concepts, roles, ethics, and security thinking

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
- **Security principles:** CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability), least privilege, defense in depth.
- **Threats & risk:** Threat vs. vulnerability vs. risk; controls (preventive, detective, corrective).
- **Roles & paths:** SOC analyst, pentester/red team, DFIR, GRC, Cloud/AppSec â€” what each focuses on.
- **Ethics & scope:** Authorization and boundaries matter; responsible disclosure mindset.
- **Processes & frameworks:** Incident response phases at a high level; why frameworks guide repeatable work.
- **Communication:** Clear notes and reporting are as important as tools.

## ðŸ§° Terms & Concepts I Want Handy
- **Assets / Threat actors / Attack surface**
- **Events vs. Alerts vs. Incidents**
- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** vs. **Indicators of Attack (IOAs)**

## ðŸ§ª How Iâ€™ll Apply This
- Keep **structured write-ups** for labs/rooms (problem â†’ approach â†’ result â†’ lesson).
- Map tools/techniques back to **risk reduction** and **controls**.
- Practice the **IR mindset** even in small labs: observe â†’ decide â†’ act â†’ document.

## ðŸ”­ Next Up
- Continue TryHackMe rooms and document learnings.
- Start building tiny helpers (e.g., log-parsing snippets) and add them here when useful.
- Prepare a lightweight **Security+** study outline.
