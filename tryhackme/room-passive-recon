## ðŸ”‘ What I learned

- Reconnaissance (recon) can be defined as a preliminary survey to gather information about a target.
- Passive Reconnaissance - accessing publicly available information without directly engaging with the target.

### Learned tools
- `whois` â€” query WHOIS servers
- `nslookup` â€” query DNS servers
- `dig` â€” query DNS servers
- [DNSDumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com) â€” online DNS mapping
- [Shodan](https://shodan.io) â€” Internet-of-Things search engine


## ðŸ§  Reflection

Passive Reconaissance is the safest method to gather information about a target without risking legal problems or raising attention. Activities include:

- Looking up DNS records of a domain from a public DNS server.
- Checking job ads related to the target website.
- Reading news articles about the target company.
