# TryHackMe: Defensive Security Intro

**Date completed:** 2025-09-03 
**Category:** Fundamentals (Defensive)

## ðŸ”‘ What I learned
- Blue team focus: preventing, detecting, and responding to attacks.
- Core concepts: logging, baselining, alerting, SIEM (e.g., correlation & triage).
- IR lifecycle: preparation â†’ identification â†’ containment â†’ eradication â†’ recovery â†’ lessons learned.
- Value of playbooks, runbooks, and repeatable processes.

## ðŸ§  Reflection
Even simple improvements to logging and visibility change whatâ€™s detectable. Iâ€™m starting to see how offense and defense inform each other.
