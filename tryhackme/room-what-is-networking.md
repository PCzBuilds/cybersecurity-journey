# TryHackMe: What is Networking

**Date completed:** 2025-09-05  
**Category:** Networking

## ðŸ”‘ What I learned
- Key terms: IP, MAC, ports, DNS, DHCP; TCP/IP vs OSI (conceptual).
- Clients/servers and how requests/responses travel across layers.
- Why networking basics underpin almost everything in security.

## ðŸ§  Reflection
Having the vocabulary (IP, ports, DNS) makes later labs less mysterious and improves troubleshooting.
