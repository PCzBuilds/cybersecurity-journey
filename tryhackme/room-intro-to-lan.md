# TryHackMe: Intro to LAN

**Date completed:** 2025-09-06  
**Category:** Networking

## ðŸ”‘ What I learned
- LAN fundamentals: switches (Layer 2), routers (Layer 3), and where each fits.
- ARP and MAC addressing; VLANs segment networks for security and performance.
- Private IP ranges, NAT, and why subnets/ masks matter.

## ðŸ§  Reflection
LAN concepts explain many attack paths (e.g., ARP-related mischief) and defensive controls (VLANs, segmentation).
